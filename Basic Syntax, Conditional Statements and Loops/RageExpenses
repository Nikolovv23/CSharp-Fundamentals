// As a MOBA challenger player, Petar has the bad habit of trashing his PC when he loses a game and of rage quiting. His gaming setup consists of a headset, mouse, keyboard,
// and display. You will receive Petar's lost games count. 
// Every second lost game, Petar trashes his headset.
// Every third lost game, Petar trashes his mouse.
// When Petar trashes both his mouse and headset in the same lost game, he also trashes his keyboard.
// Every second time, when he trashes his keyboard, he also trashes his display. 
// You will receive the price of each item in his gaming setup. Calculate his rage expenses for renewing his gaming equipment. 

// Input / Constraints
// •	On the first input line – lost games count – integer in the range [0…1000].
// •	On the second line – headset price – floating-point number in the range [0…1000].
// •	On the third line – mouse price – floating-point number in the range [0…1000].
// •	On the fourth line – keyboard price – floating-point number in the range [0…1000].
// •	On the fifth line – display price – floating-point number in the range [0… 1000].
// Output
// •	As output you must print Petar's total expenses: "Rage expenses: {expenses} lv.".
// •	Allowed working time / memory: 100ms / 16MB.

// Examples:
//     input: 7
//            2
//            3
//            4
//            5
