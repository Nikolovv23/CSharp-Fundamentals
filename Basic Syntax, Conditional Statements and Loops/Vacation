// You will receive three lines from the console:
// •	A count of people who are going on vacation.
// •	Type of the group (Students, Business or Regular).
// •	The day of the week which the group will stay on (Friday, Saturday or Sunday).
// Based on the given information calculate how much the group will pay for the entire vacation. 
// The price for a single person is as follows:

// 	        Friday		Saturday		Sunday
// Students	  8.45		  9.80			10.46
// Business	  10.90		  15.60			  16
// Regular		 15		   	20			  22.50

// There are also discounts based on some conditions:
// •	For Students – if the group is 30 or more people, you should reduce the total price by 15%.
// •	For Business – if the group is 100 or more people, 10 of the people stay for free.
// •	For Regular – if the group is between 10 and 20  people (both inclusively), reduce the total price by 5%.
// 
// Note: You should reduce the prices in that EXACT order!
// As an output print the final price which the group is going to pay in the format: 
// "Total price: {price}"
// The price should be formatted to the second decimal point.

// 	Examples:
// 	     input: 30
// 				Students
// 				Sunday
// 		 output: Total price: 266.73
