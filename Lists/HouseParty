// Create a program that keeps track of the guests that are going to a house party. On the first line, of input you are going to receive the number of commands that will follow.
// On the next lines, you are going to receive some of the following:  "{name} is going!"
// •	You have to add the person, if they are not on the guestlist already.
// •	If the person is on the list print the following to the console: "{name} is already in the list!"
// "{name} is not going!"
// •	You have to remove the person, if they are on the list. 
// •	If not, print out: "{name} is not in the list!"
// Finally, print all of the guests, each on a new line.

//     Input:
// 4
// Allie is going!
// George is going!
// John is not going!
// George is not going!
 
//     Output:
// John is not in the list!
// Allie
